# How to package Sous-Chef

1. Modify the version in `setup.py` and commit the changes. Development versions should have the following pattern:

    ```
    1.3.1.dev1
    ```

    Production versions should follow semantic versionning:

    ```
    1.3.1
    ```

2. Stop your local development server:

    ```
    docker compose down
    ```

3. Remove the `build` directory to ensure a clean build (this is especially important when you made changes to setup.py or setup.cfg). Also remove previous builds from `dist`:

    ```
    rm -rf build dist
    ```

4. Build the assets, as explained in [DEVSETUP.md](DEVSETUP.md):

    ```
    rm -rf souschef/sous_chef/assets/*
    ./tools/compile_assets.sh
    ```

5. Then, use Docker to create the source package and the wheel archive:

    ```
    docker compose run web python3 setup.py sdist
    docker compose run web python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
    ```

6. If you have a development version, upload it to test PyPI:

    ```
    twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
    ```

    For production:

    ```
    twine upload dist/*
    ```

    These commands will only work if you have proper permissions to upload to the PyPI souschef project.
