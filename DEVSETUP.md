# Installing Sous-Chef for Development

## Editor Setup

To enforce some basic standards in the Sous-Chef source files we use an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) configuration. You may find a plugin to your favorite source code editor [here](https://editorconfig.org/#download).

## Installing Docker

We recommend using Docker for developing Sous-Chef as it simplifies the setup, a great deal.

### On Linux

Install the following dependencies:

1. **docker-engine**: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
2. **docker-compose**: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

On Debian systems, the following commands can be used to install Docker:

    sudo apt install docker-compose

### OS X

Install **Docker For Mac**: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/

### Windows

For Windows 10, it is recommended to use **Docker For Windows**: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ (**notice**: Hyper-V must be enabled. Follow the instructions during installation.) Make sure that Docker icon appears in task tray and prompts "Docker is running". You can then use `cmd` or `PowerShell` to run the following commands.

For older Windows versions, you may have to use **Docker Toolbox** (https://www.docker.com/toolbox) and you must run commands from the **docker quickstart terminal** (a shortcut on desktop).

## Getting the source code

Clone the Sous-Chef repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/santropolroulant/sous-chef
cd sous-chef
```

## Building the assets

To build the assets, or rebuild them when the assets changes, run the following command:

```
./tools/compile_assets.sh
```

If you have issues with running this command it might be because you have run `npm` from your host machine to install the dependencies. Delete the `node_modules` directory and try again:

```
rm -rf tools/gulp/node_modules
```

[gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a JavasSript-based build system.
We use it to compile and optimize files from `souschef/frontend/` to `souschef/sous_chef/assets/`.
We specifically use it to compile SCSS to CSS, JavasSript to minified JavaScript, and images to further-compressed images.

## Building the Docker image and starting Sous-Chef

Running these commands will build the Docker image and start Sous-Chef:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Sous-Chef will then be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). If this is the first time you run Sous-Chef, keep-on reading, as there are a few more steps required.

## Django initialization

Unfortunately, the bulk of the Django configuration cannot happen until the containers are already built
and running, because it needs to talk to the database which is in a different container, managed by docker-compose.
So after you do the first build, you need to manually do some more steps.

In your console:

```
docker-compose run web bash
```

Then you should be inside a container as you can see, e.g., `root@d157a3f57426:/code#`. Then run:

```
cd souschef

# Run existing migrations
python3 manage.py migrate

# Create a user with administrator privileges
python3 manage.py createsuperuser

# Optional: Load the initial data set
python3 manage.py loaddata sample_data
```

## Running unit tests

To run the project's unit test suite:

```
docker-compose run web python3 /code/souschef/manage.py test
```

## How to change the JavaScript code

You first need to know that Sous-Chef's JavaScript code placed in `souschef/frontend/js`. Be careful: the JavaScript files you will find in `souschef/sous_chef/assets/js` and `souschef/static/js` are (respectively) the result of running the `gulp` command and Django's copy of the assets, and are not part of the source code nor should be committed in Git. (As a reminder, the `gulp` command is ran when you execute the `./tools/compile_assets.sh` script, and the copy of the assets is made by the `manage.py collectstatic`Â command in the `Dockerfile`.)

So the proper and formal way to change the JavaScript code is the following:

1. Edit the JavaScript code in `souschef/frontend/js`.
2. Rebuild the assets by running:

   `./tools/compile_assets.sh`.

3. Copy the assets to Django's static directory by running:

   `docker-compose run web python3 /code/souschef/manage.py collectstatic --noinput`

4. Refresh your page. The new JavaScript files should be downloaded and executed by the browser. You might need to force the page refresh (pressing shift when reloading) to clear the caches for the new code to be loaded.

## Troubleshooting

### Issues starting Sous-Chef

In case of persistent issues with starting Sous-Chef, try removing the Docker volume (which holds the database):

```
docker-compose down
docker volume rm sous-chef_souschef_data
docker-compose up --build
```

Then, redo the "Django initialization" step above.

Note: it happens that Sous-Chef cannot connect to the database, especially the first time you launch it. Simply stop the Docker processes with CTRL-C and relaunch `docker-compose up` to fix the issue.

### JavaScript served as minified file when developping

Sous-Chef will only serve non-minified JavaScript files when the IP address of the requester is listed in the INTERNAL_IPS variable in `souschef/sous_chef/settings.py`. The IPs listed in the configuration are already adjusted to using Docker Compose. If you are receiving a minified version of Sous-Chef's JavaScript code here's how to configure your development environment.

First, you need to figure-out the requester IP as seen by Django. In `souschef/page/views.py` add the following (don't commit this code though!):

```python
# Some code omitted
class HomeView:

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        # Add this print here
        print(f"REMOTE_ADDR is: {self.request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')}")
```

Then, refresh Sous-Chef's home page. In the logs (in the terminal where you started `docker-compose up`), you should see a message like this:

```
web_1  | REMOTE_ADDR is: 172.22.0.1
```

Add this IP to the INTERNAL_IPS variable in `souschef/sous_chef/settings.py`, but don't commit your changes.

## Connection to application

A Django development server is automatically started unless you have run with production settings. It is accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Backup and restore database

The database content is stored in a Docker named volume that is not directly accessible.

**For backup**, running:

```
docker run --rm --volumes-from souschef_db_1 -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /var/lib/mysql
```

In Windows console, running:

```
docker run --rm --volumes-from souschef_db_1 -v %cd%:/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /var/lib/mysql
```

`souschef_db_1` is the container's name that can be found by running `docker ps`. This command creates a temporary Ubuntu container, connects it with both the volume that `souschef_db_1` uses and current directory on host machine. You will find `backup.tar` in current directory after this command.

**For restoring**:

```
docker run --rm --volumes-from souschef_db_1 -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd /var/lib/mysql && tar xvf /backup/backup.tar --strip 1"
```

In Windows console:

```
docker run --rm --volumes-from souschef_db_1 -v %cd%:/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd /var/lib/mysql && tar xvf /backup/backup.tar --strip 1"
```

## Troubleshooting

1. `TERM environment not set`: https://github.com/dockerfile/mariadb/issues/3
2. `listen tcp 0.0.0.0:8000: bind: address already in use`: another application already uses the 8000 port. Vagrant applications often use the same port for instance. Locate the application and shut it down, or select an other port.
3. `Web server is up and running, but no answer after Django initialization`: restart your container.
4. `Static files fails to load when using Nginx server in development mode (docker-compose up)`: run `docker-compose exec web python3 souschef/manage.py collectstatic`
